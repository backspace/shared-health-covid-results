# Shared Health COVID results checker

This is a short Node.js script that logs in to an existing ‚ÄúShared Health COVID-19 Online Results Display‚Äù [account](https://shcord.verosource.com/manitoba/) (white label-esque VeroSource ‚Äúportal‚Äù), fetches the results, and txts you via Twilio if the result is changed.

On first run, it just stores the result for the next run without txting.

*Warning*: I‚Äôve never run this on an account that‚Äôs never had a test result! So this will probably break. But I‚Äôve made a guess that it‚Äôll return an empty array, so maybe it‚Äôll work ü§î

## Requirements

* Node (14.9.0, but you can use [Volta](https://volta.sh/))
* A Shared Health account and these environment variables:
  * `SHARED_HEALTH_USERNAME`
  * `SHARED_HEALTH_PASSWORD`
* A Twilio account and these environment variables:
  * `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
  * `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
  * `TWILIO_ORIGIN_NUMBER`: number to txt from
  * `TWILIO_DESTINATION_NUMBER`: number to txt, probably your own!

## Running

```
node index.js
```

It should print some messages about its behaviour.

I tried this on:
* Ubuntu 16.04/bash
* Raspbian Buster/bash
* macOS 10.14/zsh

I could only get it to work on macOS, the other two failed to fetch the token with `400 Bad Request`. I gave up on debugging what this was about, sadly, after putting more time into this than I really wanted.

Cron seemed too annoying so I just ran it in a terminal with a ‚âà20min delay:

```
while true; do date && node index.js; sleep 1200; done
```

## Example output

It actually ran for several days but here‚Äôs some fakery so you get the idea:

## Possibilities

This could use email instead and cut out the Twilio requirement. It could also store the string in another way to be more Heroku-able. I may be amenable to make these changes if people seek it, so let me know if you‚Äôre interested or have other requests.
